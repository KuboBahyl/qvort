Changelog for stacks package
============================

Release 2010-11-30 (rev. 408)

new features
- can now display vector images (display either as RGB, or display the norm)
- can read meta image files with images stored as list of slices
- show histogram of RGB images as 3 separate bands
- stacks rotations has been rewritten

GUI
- re-organized menus, and added accelerators
- better display of floating point values (zoom, pixel coords)

display
- updated computation of grayscale extent for display
- add support for Look-Up table

bug fixes
- can now display binary stacks
- metaImageInfo: read correct spatial calibration of planar images
- metaImageWrite: avoid to write too much zeros
- added a private package to avoid name conflicts

- add new visualization functions:
    + orthoSlices, 
    + showXSlice, 
    + showYSlice, 
    + showZSlice)

Release 2010-06-22

- added a dialog to change image resolution
- keep grayscale range when rotating image
- added about dialog


Release 2010-06-15

- added support for non cubic voxels
- use (x,y) user coordinates for mouse display,  instead of (row,col) indices
- added reading and writing in metaImage format
- use gray range [0 maxint] for images with non negative values 
- added display of metadata for imported images
- added basic image transformations:
    + flip in each direction
    + rotations by 90 degrees
- improved memory management


Release 2010-01-06

- Added possibility to modify grayscale range, based on image min-max, on data
	type min-max, or manual selection.
- Added import of some 3D formats (DICOM, Analyze, and Interfile)
- Added display of histogram	
- Removed zoom buttons, and put zoom options in menu bar
- Updated help and code comments
- Added function stackSlice, which extracts a 2D slice from a 3D image and
	ensures correct dimension
- changed license to modified BSD license.
